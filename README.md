Screenshot(s) of your app: 

Type in an MLB pitcher's name (past or present) and click the button. A live, career pitch count will appear on the page, followed by a ball-strike ratio. This is for calculating pitching stats and for fun! Baseball fans love hearing quirky stats, so this app will be fun for users. 

Key Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jSon
